# How to purchase MOR over time

## Set up Gnosis Safe

Hardware wallet needs to set up a gnosis safe ((https://safe.global/)
Set Signers (Gnosis safe should have minimum 1/2 signers, never make number of required signers as equal to signers with ability to sign)
Gas fees are paid by the signing address when executing a transaction ( so make sure wallet always has gas fees)
After setting up SAFE, transfer Test Amount to new Gnosis Safe 
After confirming receipt of test, send total funds to Gnosis Safe

## Set up TWAP - 
- go to apps in Gnosis Safe
- Search Cowswap (https://swap.cow.fi/#/1/swap/WETH)
Convert any ETH or currency to WETH as Swap

## Example Purchase

    - Click ok for upgrade
    - Set Slippage to whatever slippage amount (if it goes past that point then TWAP will stop purchasing and youâ€™ll need to reset
        - We set slippage to 20% to 75% depending on situation.
